# This is a repository for the team project (Phase 1).

## Opensource Software Final Project

This project is structured into three progressive phases, allowing students to explore the Opensource ecosystem, analyze real OSS communities, and collaboratively design and build a minimal yet functional OSS project.

Students will work in teams of 4. All contributions must be made through GitHub using Pull Requests, Issues, and GitHub Projects.


## Phase 1: Understanding the “Open” Ecosystem (14%)

Due Date: Week 11 (Nov 14) Presentation during class
Each group will be assigned an "Open" domain to investigate:
• Open Data, Open Science, Open Government, Opensource AI, Open Education, Opensource Hardware, Open knowledge (Our team: Ope Education)

### Objective:
Reflect on how the term “Open” is used in different contexts and how it compares to the core values of the Opensource Software movement (e.g., Stallman’s Four Freedoms).

### Deliverables:
• A short presentation (max. 10 minutes) covering:
o What is your assigned “Open” domain?
 ▪ Definition and historical roots
o Key principles and examples (platforms, initiatives, projects or communities)
o How does “Openness” in your domain compare to Openness in the OSS movement?
 ▪ Are there licenses too?
o Reflections on transparency, collaboration, peer production and community structure

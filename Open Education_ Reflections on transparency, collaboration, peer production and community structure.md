## **Reflections on transparency, collaboration, peer production and community structure**

---

### **1\. Transparency**

Transparency in Open Education operates across two key dimensions: legal permission and process visibility.

* 1.1 Legal Transparency: Creative Commons Licenses (CCL)

OER primarily uses **Creative Commons Licenses (CCL)** to clearly and legally communicate user permissions.1 Unlike traditional "All Rights Reserved" copyright, CCL grants users the **5R Permissions (Retain, Reuse, Revise, Remix, Redistribute)** 3, ensuring that the extent of their freedom is explicitly and transparently stated.

* **Analysis of the Openness Compromise:** The common use of restrictive clauses like **Non-Commercial (NC)** or **No Derivatives (ND)** creates a tension.4 While licenses containing the ND clause are generally *not* considered valid OER as they prohibit revision and remixing 5, the widespread use of the **Non-Commercial (NC)** clause is a strategic defense.6 This directly contrasts with the **OSS principle of complete freedom for all purposes**.7 The NC restriction is a pragmatic mechanism designed to protect resources—often developed with public funds—from commercial appropriation by publishers, ensuring they remain free of charge for non-profit educational users.8 This suggests OE's transparency is often **purpose-driven** (focused on educational and non-profit use) rather than absolute.  
* 1.2 Process Transparency: Open Development

OE initiatives often strive for transparency in their creation process, differentiating themselves from proprietary publishers.9

* Example: Large OER projects like **OpenStax** publish high-quality, peer-reviewed, and openly licensed materials.10 Other initiatives like **WikiEducator** utilize collaborative platforms that facilitate a continuous updating process.12 These platforms maintain **publicly accessible error logs** and involve **open peer review** processes. Minor errors can be corrected directly in the wiki, and larger issues are publicly recorded using tools like Kanboard.12 This public scrutiny and transparent tracking of modifications allow users to verify the academic integrity and current status of the materials, building trust within the community.9

### **2\. Collaboration**

Collaboration in Open Education centers on fostering active engagement and the **co-creation of knowledge**, moving beyond passive information delivery.

Global and Cross-Sectoral Cooperation

OE thrives on collaboration that transcends institutional and national boundaries.

* Key Actors: Collaboration involves a diverse group: **individual instructors**, **university consortia** (e.g., Open Education Consortium), **librarians** (who manage and curate OER) 13, and **policy makers** (who fund and mandate adoption). The role of the librarian has significantly evolved, positioning them as central infrastructure managers, archivists, and expert consultants in licensing and resource discovery.13  
* Reflection: This broad, cross-sectoral collaboration is essential for **localization** and **contextualization**, ensuring that global resources are adapted to meet specific local and cultural needs.15 Unlike OSS, where collaboration is primarily code-centric (focused on technical compatibility), OE collaboration is centered on **pedagogical content expertise**—focusing on instructional design and curriculum adaptation.16

Open Pedagogy and Collaborative Authorship

**Open Pedagogy** encourages students to engage in collaborative knowledge creation, operating within a philosophical framework that emphasizes trust, innovation, and operating within a connected community.17

* Example: Instead of completing disposable assignments, students might be tasked with **creating, revising, or translating OER** through "renewable" assignments.19 Specific instances include students contributing original chapters to public domain textbooks (like the *Open Logic Project*) or incorporating their unique group research into OER history textbooks.20  
* Outcome: This practice transforms students from mere **consumers** into active **producers** of knowledge, granting them epistemological authority.15 This is aligned with extending beyond simple knowledge acquisition to developing critical thinking and evaluation skills, as their work is subject to real-world use and external standards.23

### **3\. Peer Production**

Open Education utilizes the **Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP)** model 24, relying on the decentralized and voluntary contributions of a community to create educational resources.

Decentralization and Modularity

OER content is naturally **modular** (e.g., divided into chapters, topics, or lessons), which facilitates CBPP.19

* Mechanism: Instructors can easily contribute, revise, or remix specific modules based on their expertise, without needing to control the entire text.16 This distributed effort enables rapid development and ensures content reflects a wide variety of perspectives and pedagogical approaches.16 New frameworks, such as the Community-based, Open source, Continuous OER Authoring (COCOA) model, are being developed to leverage continuous development techniques from the software world for OER authoring.16  
* Reflection: Similar to OSS, CBPP allows for **swift error correction** and **continuous updating**, often making OER more current and responsive than commercial textbooks.16 The success of CBPP in OER is due to adapting these collaborative platforms for instructional use.25

Motivation and Non-Profit Focus

The driving force behind OE peer production differs somewhat from that of OSS. CBPP projects are fundamentally non-profit in scope.24

* OE Contributor Motivation: Key drivers include **educational responsibility**, a desire to reduce student costs (alleviating the financial burden of textbooks), and a **professional commitment** to sharing expertise for the public good.9 This contrasts with the OSS motivation, which can be linked more strongly to technical interest or reputation.16 This non-profit motivation aligns the output directly with the public good.

### **4\. Community Structure**

The structure of the Open Education community is multifaceted, designed for long-term sustainability and broad adoption.

Multi-Layered Ecosystem

The OE community is an ecosystem of various interdependent stakeholders, not just developers.

* Structure: It includes **front-line educators**, **institutional leadership** (driving adoption policies), **librarians** (acting as central managers and archivists) 13, and **advocacy groups**. The involvement of university libraries and consortia, such as the **IPAL OER Project** 27, provides a vital layer of institutional stability.  
* Reflection: This complex structure provides **institutional stability** that often bolsters the voluntary efforts of individual contributors.27 By securing support from official bodies (libraries, government mandates), the community can ensure the **long-term hosting, archival stability, and maintenance** of the resources, insulating the content from the volatility and burnout of purely volunteer-driven projects.13

Sustainability Models

To endure, OE communities rely on sustainable funding mechanisms outside of commercial sales.

* Funding: Funding sources are diversified, often including **government grants** (e.g., the Texas OER Grant Program) and **institutional subsidies** (e.g., university library budgets).28 Additionally, the U.S. Department of Education regulations have supported this by requiring competitive grant deliverables to be openly licensed.30  
* Hybrid Approach: OER organizations often adopt **fee-for-service** models to fund infrastructure without restricting core content access.26 This means the core content remains digitally free, but charges may be applied for auxiliary, scarce services or formats such as:  
  * Low-cost, print-on-demand copies.  
  * Customization services or technical integration support.  
  * Optional fees for professional development or official certification/credentialing.31

This pragmatic approach ensures resources remain open while supporting the people and infrastructure that maintain them.

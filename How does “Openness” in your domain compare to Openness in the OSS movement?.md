## Stallman 4 freedoom in open source
1.	The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
2.	The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.
3.	The freedomo to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
4.	The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits.

## David Wiley 5R permissions in open education
1.	Retain - make, own, and control a copy of the resource (eg. download and keep your own copy)
2.	Revise - edit, adapt, and modify your copy of the resource (eg. translate into another language)
3.	Remix - combine your original or revised copy of the resource with other existing material to create something new (eg. make a mashup)
4.	Reuse - use your original, revised, or remisxed copy of the resource publicly (eg. on a website, in a presentation, in a class)
5.	Redistribute - share copies of your original, revised, or remixed copy of the resource with others (eg. post a copy online or give one to a friend)


# OSS VS OER

## Common Ground : Core Values
•	Sharing and Accessibility 
Both movements ensure free access and reuse of knowledge, materials, or source code. Open Education examples like MIT OpenCourseWare follow the same free public release model as OSS (e.g., Linux).
•	Collaboration and Improvement 
Multiple participants contribute to open resources or software and facilitate further development through mutual feedback. Open Educational Resources (OER) that use Creative Commons (CC) licenses allow diverse users (students, professors, etc.) to freely revise, improve, and redistribute the material. This is similar to how open-source projects are developed on platforms like GitHub.

## Different Ground : Method of Openness and Licensing System
| Category | Open Education | Open Source Software (OSS) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Scope of Openness | Limited to educational content such as lecture materials, textbooks, and courses (non-course education possible as well). | Entire software code, often including documentation. |
| Representative Licenses  | Mostly Creative Commons (CC), some Public Domain. | MIT, GPL, Apache, BSD, etc. |
| License Characteristics | Detailed conditions based on use, modification, redistribution, and commercial use (e.g., BY, NC, SA, etc.). | Technical and legal specifics regarding copying, distribution, modification, and obligations for derivative works. |
| Copyright Attribution | Typically remains with the original author, with only sharing conditions specified. | Ownership of the source code is often community/collective-centric upon open contribution. |
| Development & Quality Control | Collaboration and "Peer Production" possible, but quality control or governance structure is usually not strong. | Existence of systematic quality control processes like Pull Requests and code reviews. |



## The Role of Licensing in Openness: Open Education vs. OSS
In both Open Education and Open Source Software (OSS), the license plays a crucial role in genuine openness, as the existence and type of license determine the actual ability to share, reuse, and modify the resource.

#### Open Education Licensing (License Existence and Types)
Most Open Educational Resources (OER) must have an open license explicitly selected and declared by the copyright holder to be recognized as OER.

Materials called "open" that only allow simple free access or viewing (e.g., free publication) are not true OER. A resource can only be considered truly open if it legally guarantees the 5Rs (Retain, Reuse, Revise, Remix, Redistribute) through a specified license like Creative Commons (CC), Public Domain, or other open licenses.

CC licenses allow for various combinations of conditions, such as Attribution (BY), NonCommercial (NC), NoDerivatives (ND), and ShareAlike (SA).

The more conditions included (e.g., 'NonCommercial'), the lower the practical openness can be. Simple publicly available material without a specified license signifies "incompleteness" as an open educational resource.

#### Open Source Software (OSS) Licensing (License Existence and Types)
OSS is only considered open source if an open source license (MIT, GPL, Apache, BSD, etc.) is explicitly declared.

Most OSS licenses clearly define the legal rights and obligations regarding the use, modification, distribution, and derivation of the software (e.g., GPL: obligating derivative works to use the same license).

"Free software" without an open source license is not OSS; legal assurance for distribution, modification, and sharing is absent, which restricts participation and collaboration.

To be recognized as true OSS, the open source license must include legally binding conditions such as attribution, license condition notice, and applying the license to derivative works.

#### Comparison Summary
| Field | License Requirement | Representative Licenses | "Openness" is Incomplete Without a License |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Open Education** | Open license must be specified for OER (mainly CC). | CC, Public Domain | Without a license, it is simple free publication, not true OER. |
| **OSS** | Open source license must be specified for OSS. | MIT, GPL, Apache, BSD, etc. | Without a license, it is not true OSS. |

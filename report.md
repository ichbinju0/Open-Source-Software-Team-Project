## Reflections on transparency, collaboration, peer production and community structure

---

### 1. Transparency

Transparency in Open Education operates across two key dimensions: legal permission and process visibility.

- 1.1 Legal Transparency: Creative Commons Licenses (CCL)

OER primarily uses **Creative Commons Licenses (CCL)** to clearly and legally communicate user permissions. Unlike traditional "All Rights Reserved" copyright, CCL grants users the **5R Permissions (Retain, Reuse, Revise, Remix, Redistribute)**, ensuring that the extent of their freedom is explicitly and transparently stated.

* Reflection: While this grants transparency, the common use of restrictive clauses like **Non-Commercial (NC)** or **No Derivatives (ND)** creates a tension. This directly contrasts with the **OSS principle of complete freedom for all purposes**, suggesting OE's transparency is often **purpose-driven** (focused on educational and non-profit use) rather than absolute.

- 1.2 Process Transparency: Open Development

OE initiatives often strive for transparency in their creation process, differentiating themselves from proprietary publishers.

* Example: Large OER projects like **OpenStax** typically maintain **publicly accessible error logs** and involve **open peer review** processes. This public scrutiny and transparent tracking of modifications allow users to verify the academic integrity and current status of the materials, building trust within the community.

### 2. Collaboration

Collaboration in Open Education centers on fostering active engagement and the **co-creation of knowledge**, moving beyond passive information delivery.

Global and Cross-Sectoral Cooperation

OE thrives on collaboration that transcends institutional and national boundaries.

* Key Actors: Collaboration involves a diverse group: **individual instructors**, **university consortia** (e.g., Open Education Consortium), **librarians** (who manage and curate OER), and **policy makers** (who fund and mandate adoption).
* Reflection: This broad, cross-sectoral collaboration is essential for **localization** and **contextualization**, ensuring that global resources are adapted to meet specific local and cultural needs. Unlike OSS, where collaboration is primarily code-centric, OE collaboration is focused on **pedagogical content expertise**.

Open Pedagogy and Collaborative Authorship

**Open Pedagogy** encourages students to engage in collaborative knowledge creation.

* Example: Instead of completing disposable assignments, students might be tasked with **creating, revising, or translating OER** (e.g., contributing a chapter to a public domain textbook or editing a Wikipedia entry).
* Outcome: This practice transforms students from mere **consumers** into active **producers** of knowledge, making the learning process itself a collaborative knowledge-building exercise.

### 3. Peer Production

Open Education utilizes the **Commons-Based Peer Production (CBPP)** model, relying on the decentralized and voluntary contributions of a community to create educational resources.

Decentralization and Modularity

OER content is naturally **modular** (e.g., divided into chapters, topics, or lessons), which facilitates CBPP.

* Mechanism: Instructors can easily contribute, revise, or remix specific modules based on their expertise. This distributed effort enables rapid development and ensures content reflects a wide variety of perspectives and pedagogical approaches.
* Reflection: Similar to OSS, CBPP allows for **swift error correction** and **continuous updating**, often making OER more current and responsive than commercial textbooks.

Motivation and Non-Profit Focus

The driving force behind OE peer production differs somewhat from that of OSS.

* OE Contributor Motivation: Key drivers include **educational responsibility**, a desire to reduce student costs, and a **professional commitment** to sharing expertise, rather than solely technical interest or reputation. This non-profit motivation aligns the output directly with the public good.

### 4. Community Structure

The structure of the Open Education community is multifaceted, designed for long-term sustainability and broad adoption.

Multi-Layered Ecosystem

The OE community is an ecosystem of various interdependent stakeholders, not just developers.

* Structure: It includes **front-line educators**, **institutional leadership** (driving adoption policies), **librarians** (acting as central managers and archivists), and **advocacy groups**.
* Reflection: This complex structure provides **institutional stability** that often bolsters the voluntary efforts of individual contributors. By securing support from official bodies (libraries, government mandates), the community can ensure the **long-term hosting and maintenance** of the resources, addressing a key challenge of purely volunteer-driven OSS projects.

Sustainability Models

To endure, OE communities rely on sustainable funding mechanisms outside of commercial sales.

* Funding: This often includes **government grants**, **institutional subsidies** (e.g., university library budgets), and sometimes optional fee-for-service models (e.g., print-on-demand copies or certification fees) which help fund core maintenance without restricting the free digital access. This pragmatic approach ensures resources remain open while supporting the people and infrastructure that maintain them.
